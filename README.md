## Information:
Hello there, my name is Frosty, and I'm a 22 year old software developer from Slovenia. I have been involved in Minecraft Plugin development for around five years so far, with a hint of non-Minecraft related development as well. During my time learning Java (and some Kotlin as well, with a hint of C#, C++ and Go), I have made countless plugins varying from simple utilities, smaller feature additions, to even full-blown gamemodes. As most of my projects are commissions done for other people/servers, they are not always Open Sourced, however I try my best to share the source if possible. At the current state of time I'm working on creating content for various servers. <br />
